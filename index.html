      John Lennon is the most famous and most iconic member of the Beatles. Revered as the band's founder and lead singer, he is also credited by some as the main cause of the Liverpool boys' breakup. Controversies aside, Lennon is eternal in the hearts of fans, as well as all the other members.
      The singer's life ended in the most tragic way possible, but anyone who thinks that the challenges began in adulthood is wrong. John Lennon's trajectory was marked by ups and downs, always with lots of music and composing those lyrics that we love, full of inspiring phrases.
